# Dino-Drag-Game
A simple endless runner game inspired by the classic Chrome Dino game. Built using Unity and C#, this project features basic game mechanics like jumping to avoid obstacles, score tracking, and progressively increasing difficulty. The player controls a dinosaur, leaping over cacti and other obstacles as the game speeds up.
